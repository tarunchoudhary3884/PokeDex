# Pokédex React App

This Pokédex application is built with React, providing a user-friendly interface to search and view Pokémon information. It's designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

## Infinite Scroll Implementation

The Pokédex features an intuitive Infinite Scroll functionality for a seamless and uninterrupted exploration experience. As you scroll through the Pokémon list, additional batches of Pokémon are automatically loaded, ensuring a continuous flow of discovery without the need for manual navigation.

## Lazy Loading for Images

The Pokédex incorporates the modern technique of lazy loading for images, enhancing the overall performance and user experience. Lazy loading ensures that images are loaded only when they are about to be displayed on the user's screen, reducing initial page load times and optimizing resource usage.

### Key Highlights:

- **Faster Initial Load:** Images are loaded on-demand, leading to quicker initial page loading times.
- **Effortless Exploration:** No need to click through pages; simply scroll down, and more Pokémon will reveal themselves.
- **Improved Performance:** Utilizing Infinite Scroll optimizes resource usage, providing a smoother and faster browsing experience.
